# Product-cards

## Description
This is my first software school homework. It is just html and css to get used to using html tags and formatting css styling. It was the first time I'd ever done anything like this. I'm really proud of it.

### Feature List
* Show product cards for four kinds of fruit available in Nintendo's Animal Crossing: New Horizons
* Basic information shown in a visually pleasing way--lots of centering, bullet points, and snarky descriptions
* Rounded borders just 'cause
